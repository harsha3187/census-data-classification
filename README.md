Anlyzing the data of a Really Big Financial Corporation.  
It is marketing the specialized financial products geared for different income levels of potential customers.  
Instead of wasting time and money to market the products to individuals that are not a good fit based on their income level.
We have downloaded and cleaned up a set of data from the US Census Department.  The data includes demographic and other data from a Census survey.   
•	From the dataset “Census Data”  try to predict who makes more the $50,000.00 dollars per year and who makes less.
•	The Target attribute is “Income”:  <= 50K, >50K.
